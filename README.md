# Garden CSS Components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/css-components.svg?token=dDt9s6smCMgz269xNbpz&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/css-components)

> :seedling: Garden is a design system for Zendesk

Garden CSS provides consistent styling for Garden components. Component
CSS is maintained following a multi-package approach where components
are packaged and published individually but combined under this single
repository.

Component CSS may be used in isolation or together with a variety of web
application frameworks. However, many projects will benefit from the
added behavioral functionality provided by [Garden React
Components](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components).

## Installation

Before you start, be sure [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is installed
on your system.

Simply execute `yarn` under a clone of this repository in order to
install Garden CSS components for development. A git `post-checkout` and
`post-merge` hook will automatically `yarn` in order to keep your
development environment up to date as you checkout and merge between
branches.

See [package registry
documentation](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/LANDSCAPE/wiki/Package-Registry)
for the configuration needed to install `@zendesk`-scoped packages as
dependencies in your own program.

## Usage

After CSS components have been installed, the following commands are
available:

- `yarn start` to launch component demo server with live reload â€“
  package source files will be watched for changes.
- `yarn test` to run tests across all component packages. Note this is
  run as a git `pre-push` hook for all packages that have changed since
  the last release.
- `yarn lint` to enforce consistent CSS and JavaScript code conventions
  across all component packages. Note this is run as a git `pre-commit`
  hook.
- `yarn format` to enforce code style with opinionated formats (i.e.
  package.json) across all component packages. Note this is run as a git
  `pre-commit` hook.
- `yarn build` to rebuild distributions across all packages. The build
  runs as part of the initial install.
- `yarn new <component>` to generate a new CSS `component` based on a
  package template. The new component demo page is launched upon
  completion.
