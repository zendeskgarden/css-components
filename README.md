# Garden CSS Components [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/css-components.svg?token=dDt9s6smCMgz269xNbpz&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/zendeskgarden/css-components)

> :seedling: Garden is a design system for Zendesk

Garden CSS provides consistent styling for Garden components. Component
CSS is maintained following a multi-package approach where components
are packaged and published individually, but combined under this single
repository.

## Installation

See the individual package README for the CSS component you would like
to install.

## Usage

Component CSS may be used in isolation or together with a variety of web
application frameworks. However, many projects will benefit from the
added behavioral functionality provided by [Garden React
Components](https://github.com/zendeskgarden/react-components).
