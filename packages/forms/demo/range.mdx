# Range

Component classes for your range fields. Child component classes are shown
below. The unmodified `.c-range` parent occupies 100% of the width of its
container. Since WebKit browsers have no supporting pseudo-element for the
lower range, the `.c-range__input` child contains corresponding background
CSS whose size should be manipulated via JavaScript whenever the range
"thumb" is moved.

  <Story of={RangeStories.Default} />
